### Abstract

The ever-growing demand for computing professionals requires the effective management of educational resources. With the increasing importance of computer science programs in the Global South, identifying potential dropout students has become crucial for educational institutions. However, predicting which students are likely to drop out poses a significant challenge. 

To address this issue in the Computer Science Education program of the Federal University of Paran√° (Brazil), we propose an approach that leverages machine learning to analyze different features associated with the student's academic performance and detect possible dropouts. Our methodology involves collecting and preprocessing a comprehensive dataset comprising student academic performance in individual subjects. 

We compare the performance of 15 machine learning algorithms in predicting student dropouts, additionally identifying the most influential variables contributing to this situation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments using real data collected from the computer science education program. 

The results demonstrate the efficacy of our machine learning-based approach in identifying students at risk of dropping out. By leveraging the identified risk cases, educational institutions can intervene early and support students, increasing retention rates and overall student success.
